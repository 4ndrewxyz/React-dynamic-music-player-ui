- **Dynamic Backgrounds** - Smooth animated gradient backgrounds that match the music's mood
- **Lava Lamp Animations** - Fluid, organic blob animations with colors from the album art
- **Squiggly Progress Bar** - Playful, Android 13-inspired animated progress indicator
- **Animated Controls** - Interactive buttons with satisfying micro-animations
- **Responsive Design** - Adapts beautifully to different screen sizes

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
